To capture wifi-packets including radio information, use the following steps:

1. Open the capture device with libpcap
2. Set the datalink type to radiotap.
3. Capture packets and hand them to a process packet function.
4. Extract the radiotap header using pointer magic.
5. With the information obtained from the radiotap header, extract the rest of the radiotap information. (see radioparser.c)
6. Extract the source MAC from the encapsulated ethernet frame (10 bytes after the end of the radiotap data)
